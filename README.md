My code and notes from Neural Networks from Scratch in Python by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça (Harrison Kinsley aka Sentdex on YouTube)
 - It is a book that teaches you how neural networks work by walking you through how to fully code your own in Python

The notebooks I've uploaded contain the code in the book that I've followed along with as well as notes I've taken to help further my understanding and gain intuition about the mathematics and concepts.
