    " - Can also use a decay rate that decreases the learning rate per batch or per epoch, such as a 1/t decay or exponential decay.\n",
    " - we will use learning rate decay, specifically: starting_learning rate * (1 / (1+ learning_rate_decay * step_number)). So the larger the step number (scaled by the decay factor) the lower the learning rate. This form also ensure that we do not accidently increase learning rate by divinding by a value less than 1, hence the adding 1.\n",

    "- momentum creates a rolling average of gradients over some number of epochs or training steps\n",
    "- helps to avoid getting stuck in local minimums because if previous gradients were very high, they will play into the current weight update, which might be small because the model is near a local minimum. So the momentum will increase the weight update preventing the model from getting stuck in the local minimum\n",
    "- kind of like a ball rolling down a hill, the steeper the hill, the bigger the hill on the other side you need to slow it down\n",
    "- in other words, the momentum helps you stay on the path of global gradient descent -looking at the greater overall average gradient - than just the gradient that is what is right next to you.\n",
    "- weight_updates_with_momentum = self.momentum * layer.weight_momentums - self.current_learning_rate * layer.dweights; where self.momentum is a momentum hyperparameter between 0 and 1 and weight momentums is an array of previous weight momentums, consisting of the previous weight updates: layer.weight_momentums = weight_updates, instantiated at 0s.\n",
    "- so basically the momentum is the previous update to the parameters, then we just incorporate new gradient info by subtracting the current gradient times the learning rate. The greater the momentum parameter, the greater the weight on the previous gradients * learning rates\n",
    "- thinking through, if momentum parameter is > 0 and the previous step was a very high gradient, then the next step is in the same direction, then the gradient update will increase. If it is in the opposite then it will decrease, but be greater than it would've been without momentum. This is where the momentum prevents the falling into local minimum. With each new step, there is greater emphasis on more recent gradient updates and the other update values are overwritten by the rolling sum, and more so if momentum param < 1. This is an exponential moving average"
