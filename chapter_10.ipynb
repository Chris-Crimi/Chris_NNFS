    " - Can also use a decay rate that decreases the learning rate per batch or per epoch, such as a 1/t decay or exponential decay.\n",
    " - we will use learning rate decay, specifically: starting_learning rate * (1 / (1+ learning_rate_decay * step_number)). So the larger the step number (scaled by the decay factor) the lower the learning rate. This form also ensure that we do not accidently increase learning rate by divinding by a value less than 1, hence the adding 1.\n",
