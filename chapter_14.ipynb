    "L1 and L2 Regularization\n",
    "- the goal of regularization is to prevent weights and biases from becoming too high by penalizing large weights and biases. A very high weight indicates a neuron may be trying to memorize a feature, based on the idea that its better to have many neurons contribute to the network output than a few.\n",
    "- there are two types of regularization L1 and L2, and they follow a general form of adding a penatly gradient to the gradient of loss wrt layer's weights and biases.    "
