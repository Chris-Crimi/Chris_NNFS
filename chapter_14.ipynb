    "- the goal of regularization is to prevent weights and biases from becoming too high by penalizing large weights and biases. A very high weight indicates a neuron may be trying to memorize a feature, based on the idea that its better to have many neurons contribute to the network output than a few.\n",

    "- L1 - absolute value of the weights or bias times a penalty hyperparamter lamda added to the loss function. In our implementation, we sum all the weights/bias for a layer and multiply the lambda hyper parameter to that sum. Just increases loss by the abs value of the weight/bias. Please note that this is to calculate loss of total function, in backward pass penalty gradient is calculated on parameter level. Formula = lambda * sum(abs(weights)); weights = weights in layer, replace weights with bias for bias form\n",
    "- L2 - squared value of the weight/bias. This is summed up for all the weights/bias in layer. Adds penatly that scales with the weight, penalizing larger weights, and not affecting smaller weights as much. weight^2 (or bias) impact on loss. Formula = lambda * sum(weights^2); weights = weights in layer, replace weights with bias for bias form. Again, please note that this is for the loss value for the whole network, not derivative of layer.\n",
    "- the non-linear impact of L2 regularization impacts smaller weights less and larger weights more. the linear nature of L1 regularization impacts small weights more and can cause a model to become invariant to small values, and variant only to larger values. (i.e., because you are adding a constant value in L1, it is relatively larger to smaller weight values, having a much greater impact on pushing them to 0). As such L2 regularization is used more often than L1, and L1 is rarely used on its own.\n",
    "- lambda is the penalty scalar that dicates how strong the penalty is\n",
    "- in our implementation we set lambda independently for each layer. This is a more efficient solution, per chat GPT, as it would be a lot to set individual lambdas, but still maintains flexibility. It is simpler and more interpretable.\n",
    "- regularization drives model parameters closer to 0, thus forcing the network to not memorize the data, because as mentioned previosuly, very high weight/bias can mean the network is memorizing. It does this by increasing loss in the first degree and in the second degree, causing bigger steps towards 0 during backprop, expanded upon in following notes."
